# Small comparison of capabilities of local deepseek-r1-14b and online ChatGPT

The following script shows the last code that deepseek and chatGPT generated.
This is to demonstrate how the AI performed on various development tasks.
How much time do they need to complete the tasks.
And if they are useful for daily software engineering tasks.

I leave the quality of the generated code to your judgment.
The idea was to not interfere and leave the troubleshooting to the agents. 
Without thinking, just copy and paste and try to run the solutions.
